# Project: TransKeep
# Project Key: TK-MVP
# Tracking System: file-system
# Story Location: docs/sprint-artifacts

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists but tech context not created
#   - contexted: Epic tech context has been generated (prerequisite for story drafting)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic/plan file
#   - drafted: Story file created in docs/sprint-artifacts/
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under review / ready for code review
#   - done: Story completed and approved
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Stories should be 'drafted' with acceptance criteria, tasks, and time estimates
# - Stories with context files are 'ready-for-dev'
# - SM/Dev moves story to 'review' when implementation complete
# - Story moves to 'done' after review and testing complete
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be worked
# - Retrospectives are optional but recommended after each epic completes
